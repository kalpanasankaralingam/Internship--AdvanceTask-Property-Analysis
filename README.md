# Internship--AdvanceTask-Property-Analysis
## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains solutions for the **BI Developer/Data Analyst Advanced Sprint**, covering **Data Engineering, Power BI Visualization, and SSRS Reporting**. The project follows industry best practices in **Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Analysis**, focusing on **Data Consolidation, ETL Processing, Data Modeling, and Interactive Reporting**.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Components  
### **ðŸ”¹ Part 1: Data Engineering & Data Warehouse**  
- Collected and consolidated **property-related data** from multiple sources.  
- Stored the **cleaned and transformed data** in **staging tables** before loading it into the **Data Warehouse**.  
- Designed a **Snowflake Schema Model** for optimized querying and reporting.  
- Developed **SSIS packages** for automated **ETL processing**.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Part 2: SSRS Reporting**  
- Created **SSRS paginated reports** for in-depth property analysis.  
- Configured **dynamic parameters** to enable drill-through analysis based on **state, city, and suburb**.  
- Deployed SSRS reports to the **SSRS web portal** for seamless access.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Part 3: Power BI Dashboard**  
- Imported the **data warehouse model** into Power BI.  
- Developed **interactive dashboards** covering:  
  - **House Value Analysis**  
  - **Rental Value Trends**  
  - **School Locations & Ratings**  
  - **Public Transport Accessibility**  
  - **Crime Statistics by Region**  
- Implemented **slicers and filters** for enhanced user experience.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Part 4: Power BI & SSRS Integration**  
- Linked **Power BI dashboard** to **SSRS reports** using **clickable hyperlinks**.  
- Configured **parameterized navigation** from Power BI to SSRS, passing **state, city, and suburb** as filters.  

## ðŸš€ How to Use the Power BI Report  
1. **Open the Power BI (.pbix) file**.  
2. Navigate through the **interactive pages**.  
3. Use **filters and slicers** to refine insights.  
4. Click on **hyperlinks** to open corresponding **SSRS reports** in the web portal.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion  
This project demonstrates **end-to-end BI reporting**, from **data integration** to **interactive dashboards**. The **Power BI report** provides **business-ready insights** into the **property market**, making data-driven decision-making easier.  

---  
**ðŸ“Œ Note:** Only the final **Power BI (.pbix) report** is uploaded as the project deliverable.
